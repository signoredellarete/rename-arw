# rename-arw

## Description
**rename-arw** is a script, for MAC OS & Linux, that operates in the folder in which it is launched and renames all the RAW files with `.ARW` extension following this format:

`YYYYMMDDHHmmss-<pattern><filename>`

> `<pattern>` must be provided by user.

> `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` is retrieved from the datetime metadata of the file.

## Installation
> This script will work if the following commands are already in the system: `file`, `cut`, `tr`

## Notes
> This little script was written for a friend who needed to automate the file renaming operation he used to perform manually on `.ARW` files generated by his camera, before importing them into Lightroom.
New features and/or bug fixing will be add to this repository.
